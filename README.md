# CodTech VLSI Internship Project

This repository contains the four tasks completed for the VLSI internship.

## Task 1: 8-bit ALU
- Designed a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting ADD, SUB, AND, OR, and NOT operations.
- Verified using a Verilog testbench.

## Task 2: Synchronous RAM
- Developed an 8x8 (8 locations, 8-bit data) synchronous RAM with read and write capabilities.
- Verified by writing to and reading from memory locations.

## Task 3: 4-Stage Pipelined Processor
- Designed a simplified 4-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, WB) for a processor.
- Demonstrated the pipeline's operation with ADD, SUB, and LOAD instructions.

## Task 4: 3-Tap FIR Filter
- Designed a digital FIR low-pass filter.
- Verified its functionality by observing its smoothing effect on a step input.
